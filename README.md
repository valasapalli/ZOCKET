# ZOCKET
 architecture overview for your Product Management System with Asynchronous Image Processing in Go, covering architectural best practices, asynchronous processing, caching, logging, and scalability.


---

System Requirements

1. Features:

CRUD operations for products.

Asynchronous image upload and processing (e.g., resizing, compression, format conversion).

Caching for frequently accessed data.

Scalable API endpoints.

2. Non-Functional Requirements:

High availability and scalability.

Logging for debugging and monitoring.

Modular, testable codebase.

Graceful error handling and recovery.
---

Tech Stack

1. Backend Framework: Go (Golang).

2. Database: PostgreSQL (for relational data) + Redis (for caching).

3. Message Queue: RabbitMQ or Kafka (for asynchronous image processing).

4. Object Storage: AWS S3  (for storing processed images).

5. Logging: Zap.

6. Server: Gorilla Mux, Gin, or Chi (for building REST APIs).

7. Deployment: Docker(for scalability).

8. Testing: Go’s built-in testing package.

System Architecture

1. Core Components

API Layer:
Handles incoming HTTP requests.
Routes requests to appropriate handlers (e.g., Product CRUD, Image upload).

Image Processing Worker:
Listens to a message queue for image processing tasks.
Performs operations like resizing, compression, etc.
Saves processed images to S3/MinIO.
Database Layer:

Manages product data (PostgreSQL).

Caches frequently accessed queries (Redis).


Caching Layer:

Stores product data and metadata.

Reduces database load for frequently accessed items.


Logging & Monitoring:

Captures API requests, errors, and system health metrics.

Implementation Details

2. Endpoints

1. POST /products:
Create a product (metadata only).



2. GET /products/{id}:
Fetch product details, using Redis for caching.



3. PUT /products/{id}:
Update product details.

4. DELETE /products/{id}:
Delete a product.



5. POST /products/{id}/images:

Upload an image for a product, which is queued for asynchronous processing.

3. Image Processing Flow

1. Image Upload:

The uploaded image is saved temporarily, and its details are pushed to a message queue.

2. Message Queue:

A worker listens for messages and processes the image (resizing, compression, etc.).

3. Image Storage:

Processed images are stored in S3 or MinIO, and their URLs are updated in the database.
4. Code Snippets

Main Application (API Layer)

package main

import (
	"log"
	"net/http"
	"github.com/go-chi/chi/v5"
)

func main() {
	r := chi.NewRouter()
	r.Post("/products", CreateProduct)
	r.Get("/products/{id}", GetProduct)
	r.Put("/products/{id}", UpdateProduct)
	r.Delete("/products/{id}", DeleteProduct)
	r.Post("/products/{id}/images", UploadImage)

	log.Println("Server is running on :8080")
	http.ListenAndServe(":8080", r)
}

Main Application (API Layer)

package main

import (
	"log"
	"net/http"
	"github.com/go-chi/chi/v5"
)

func main() {
	r := chi.NewRouter()
	r.Post("/products", CreateProduct)
	r.Get("/products/{id}", GetProduct)
	r.Put("/products/{id}", UpdateProduct)
	r.Delete("/products/{id}", DeleteProduct)
	r.Post("/products/{id}/images", UploadImage)

	log.Println("Server is running on :8080")
	http.ListenAndServe(":8080", r)
}
for msg := range msgs {
		log.Printf("Processing image: %s", string(msg.Body))
		// Perform image processing
		ProcessImage(string(msg.Body))
	}
}

func ProcessImage(imagePath string) {
	log.Printf("Processed image: %s", imagePath)
	// Add image resizing, compression, etc.
}

Database & Caching Example

package main

import (
	"database/sql"
	"github.com/go-redis/redis/v8"
	_ "github.com/lib/pq"
)

var (
	db    *sql.DB
	cache *redis.Client
)

func init() {
	var err error
	db, err = sql.Open("postgres", "user=postgres password=secret 
 dbname=products sslmode=disable")
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}

	cache = redis.NewClient(&redis.Options{
		Addr: "localhost:6379",
	})
}

5. Scalability Considerations

Use load balancers (e.g., Nginx or AWS ALB) to distribute traffic.
Use auto-scaling groups in Kubernetes to manage sudden spikes.
Optimize database queries and indexes to handle large-scale operations.
Implement retries and circuit breakers for message processing.
